file-system structure:

1- / (root filesystem)
  The root filesystem is the top-level directory of the filesystem. It must contain all of the files required 
  to boot the Linux system before other filesystems are mounted. It must include all of the required executables 
  and libraries required to boot the remaining filesystems. After the system is booted, all other filesystems are
  mounted on standard, well-defined mount points as subdirectories of the root filesystem.

2- /bin
  This is where the executable files are located. These files are available to all users

3- /dev
  These are device drivers

4- /etc
  Supervisor directory commands, configuration files, disk configuration files, valid user lists, groups, ethernet, hosts, where to send critical messages

5- /lib
  Contains shared library files and sometimes other kernel-related files

6- /boot
  Contains files for booting the system

7- /home
  Contains the home directory for users and other accounts

8- /mnt
  Used to mount other temporary file systems, such as cdrom and floppy for the CD-ROM drive and floppy diskette drive, respectively

9- /proc
  Contains all processes marked as a file by process number or other information that is dynamic to the system

10- /tmp
  Holds temporary files used between system boots

11- /usr
  Used for miscellaneous purposes, and can be used by many users. Includes administrative commands, shared files, library files, and others

12- /var
  Typically contains variable-length files such as log and print files and any other type of file that may contain a variable amount of data	

13- /sbin
  Contains binary (executable) files, usually for system administration. For example, fdisk and ifconfig utlities	

14- /opt
  Optional files such as vendor supplied application programs should be located here.

15- /media
  A place to mount external removable media devices such as USB thumb drives that may be connected to the host.
